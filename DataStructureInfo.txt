The files contain the images, curves, and labels for the regular polygon dataset. The number at the end of the file name indicates the resolution of the image grid.

Structure of files
RegularPolyCurves###.npy
List where each element contains all the bezier curves (line segments) that make up the polygon.


RegularPolyImgs###.npy
(...,grid_size,grid_size) 3D array where each ... is an image of the polygon.


RegularPolyLabels###.npy
(...,largest Num Sides - 2) 2D array where each row is a one hot of what shape it is. If the largest number of sides is six then the 2D array has size (...,4). 
Examples (largest shape hexagon)
triangle: 	(1, 0, 0, 0)
square: 	(0, 1, 0, 0)
pentagon:	(0, 0, 1, 0)
hexagon: 	(0, 0, 0, 1)
If the largest shape was an octagon then each one hot would have two more zeros at the end.

General Notes:
To get sample x data, take the xth element of the list (Curves), xth 2D array of IMGs, xth row of the Labels.
